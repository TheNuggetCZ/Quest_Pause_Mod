A Minecraft mod for fabric 1.19.2, curseforge page: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quest-pause

What it does: The game is now paused when you open the quest menu enabling you to read or manage your quests without worrying about mobs killing you. Main script is located in "src/main/java/net/nugget/questpause/mixin/BaseScreenMixin.java".

Second Minecraft mod I made. I coded this pretty much just for myself and uploaded it to curseforge if anyone needed it too.
